        <p class="text-width-news middle margin-bottom margin-top">At Chalk Climbing Centre, we prioritize the safety
            and well-being of our climbers. That's why we have
            implemented a mandatory induction process for all first-time climbers. Our dedicated staff members are
            committed to providing a thorough and comprehensive training session before climbers are allowed to scale
            our indoor rock climbing walls. During the induction, our experienced instructors cover essential topics
            such as equipment usage, proper harness fitting, belaying techniques, and the correct way to tie knots. We
            ensure that each climber understands the fundamental safety procedures and protocols before they begin their
            climbing journey. This mandatory induction helps create a safe and supportive environment for all climbers,
            ensuring that everyone is well-prepared and confident in their abilities. So, whether you're a beginner or
            an experienced climber, our induction process is designed to ensure a secure and enjoyable experience for
            all at Chalk Climbing Centre.</p>
